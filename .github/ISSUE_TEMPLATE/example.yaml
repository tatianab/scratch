        Thanks for taking the time to file a vulnerability report to the
        Go vulnerability database!

        Filling out this form creates a **public** issue on the x/vulndb issue tracker containing all the details you report. 
        
        It is intended only for PUBLIC vulnerabilities in publicly importable Go packages not maintained by the Go Team (i.e., anything outside the Go standard library, Go toolchain, and golang.org modules).

        Please report all issues directly to project maintainers
        following their security policy **before** creating an issue here.

        ‚ùó To report undisclosed Go vulnerabilities, please follow our [security policy](https://go.dev/security/policy) instead.

        For questions or concerns, do not hesitate to reach out to us directly at security@golang.org.
