        Thanks for taking the time to file a vulnerability report to the Go vulnerability database!

        Filling out this form creates a **public** issue on the x/vulndb issue tracker containing all the details you report.

        This issue tracker is used solely to track the work of adding/updating the Go vulnerability database, not to track the work of fixing or mitigating vulnerabilities. 
        
        It is intended only for PUBLIC vulnerabilities in publicly importable Go packages not maintained by the Go Team (i.e., anything outside the Go standard library, Go toolchain, and golang.org modules).

        ❗ Please report new issues directly to project maintainers following their security policy **before** creating an issue here.

        ❗ To report undisclosed Go standard library or toolchain vulnerabilities, please follow our [security policy](https://go.dev/security/policy) instead.

        For questions or concerns, do not hesitate to reach out to us directly at security@golang.org.
